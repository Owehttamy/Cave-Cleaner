This data pack is used to kill any persistent or "unclean" zombies that have picked up items and now won't despawn.
This is done by using the "/trigger cave_glow" and "/trigger cave_cleaner" commands in spectator mode.
Want to see it in action? Check out Xisumavoid's video on the pack and how it's used: https://youtu.be/NpOszQWKC8s?t=119

This datapack was originally created by Grant from the Vanilla Tweaks team and was used on the Hermitcraft Season 8 world.
BUT, this is an unofficial—and therefore unsupported—version of the datapack, as I have modified the files to update and improve the pack to the latest version.

If you would like to download the official (and outdated) version of the cave cleaner datapack, you will find it in the datapacks folder here:
https://download.hermitcraft.com/hermitcraft8.zip

Why isn't there an official version of the Cave Cleaner datapack?
	Quote from Grant: "A lot of people would want to configure it (like by changing the items, radius, etc), and I don't like requiring people to go into the data for basic configuration.
	Since that isn't very user-friendly, and we wouldn't want to be obligated to give lots of people support for going into the files to configure it either, or have to write FAQs for it."

Could it not be done through an options menu?
	Grant: "Not really, since it's based on tags. Those can only be modified using JSON, not commands.
	We could, hypothetically, implement something that is based on commands but it would be really messy and/or inefficient."
	(Clearly he decided it was not in his best interest)



Thanks to Grant from the Vanilla Tweaks team for creating the original datapack and pointing me to where I could find the files. You can find some of his other work here:
